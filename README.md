Cherry Tree is a set of tools that were originally designed to help
build releases for
[Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset),
but can be use for any other project
that wants to implement a similar workflow.

Ideas behind `cherrytree` include:
* Baking and storing release metadata in config static files
* Github label driven development / releases
* Make release files from specifying base reference and Github labels
* Bake release branches/SHAs from said config files
* Follow a base reference + cherries approach
